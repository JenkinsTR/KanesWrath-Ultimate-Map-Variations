---------------------------
## THE VARIATIONS:

**Lone Wolf (LONEWOLF):**

This is a "Commandos Only" mode. Scrin have severe balance issues when limiting them to just the Mastermind. For Scrin & Scrin-based factions only, a CORRUPTER is used instead of the Mastermind Commando.
The Corrupter's stats are similar to the NOD and GDI Commando (except cost) but playtests have been good with this substitution so far.
This mode has all other support powers, upgrades & superweapons disabled, as well as All Tanks and Air Units disabled.

---------------------------
**No Superweapons (NOSW):**

This is pretty self explanatory. All factions super weapons have been DISABLED.
The idea of No Superweapons is to balance (and extend) the later end-game gameplay.

---------------------------
** No Superweapons / No Upgrades (NOSW_NOUP):**

This is pretty self explanatory. All factions super weapons have been DISABLED.
The idea of No Superweapons is to balance (and extend) the later end-game gameplay.

---------------------------
**No Aircraft (NOAIR)**

Also self explanatory, and I also DISABLED the ability to build Anti Air structures and Units dedicated to AA.
This mode is perfect for large base building, as you are restricted to purely ground units.

---------------------------
**No Superweapons, No Upgrades AND No Aircraft (NOSW_NOAIR)**

A combination of the above 2. My personal favourite map variation.
ALL AIR UNITS/STRUCTURES, SUPPORT POWERS, UPGRADES and SUPERWEAPONS are all DISABLED.
This is also the best mode for large base building and tower defense style.

---------------------------
**Infantry Only (INFONLY)**

Again this one explains itself. Pure infantry.
War Factories can be built to build MCV and Harvesters.
AIRCRAFT, TANKS UNITS/STRUCTURES and ANTI-AA and ANTI-TANK defenses are also DISABLED.

---------------------------
**Tanks Only (TNKSONLY)**

Another self explatory variation.

---------------------------
## Tidbits:

- This is a follow-up to my previously released pack for RA3: https://www.moddb.com/games/cc-red-alert-3/addons/pack-ultimate-ra3-official-map-variations

- Included are all the official BONUS maps (Cut maps, PreOrder maps etc) and their respective variations.

- These work on Digital (Steam, Origin) & Retail (Disc, other) copies of Kane's Wrath.

- I've been having a strange issue with 3 particular maps. They refuse to appear when edited;
```
BAMAP_EW01_4    "Unsound Investment"
BAMAP_EW08_04    "Eastern Promises"
BAMAP_JF01_4    "Dockside Devastation"
```

These have been included in the _NOT_WORKING folder but as stated, do not appear in the Map Selection screen.

- It is also MULTIPLAYER COMPATIBLE! NOTE: YOU AND THE OTHER PLAYERS ALL NEED THE SAME PACK INSTALLED TO WORK IN MP.
Due to EA shutting down Gamespy servers, public official Multiplayer is no longer possible,
however, you can still LAN this game through services like CNC-Net or similar.

- It is NOT compatible with C&C3: Tiberium Wars.

- I have included the scripts I created to make this pack possible.
They should be located with the download in the `Scripts` folder.

---------------------------
## Install instructions:

1. After extracting the download, copy or move the contents to `C:\Users\<MyUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Command & Conquer 3 Kane's Wrath\Maps`

2. Launch the game

3. When you navigate to Skirmish > New after installing a lot of maps,
it will take some time to regenerate all the map overlay thumbnails. BE PATIENT!

4. Done!
